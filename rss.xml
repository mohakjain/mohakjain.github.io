Today, I wanted to talk about one of the hottest startups taking on alternative food not in meat, but in dairy products, Perfect Day. Then, I want to discuss the path forward for alternative food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative dairy has many ethical and environmental benefits— including avoiding overuse of antibiotics, factory farming, and no added hormones. Still, it’s clear that to be commercially viable, Perfect Day and other alternative food companies will have to give the public something more to look forward to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect Day uses synthetic biology processes to ferment milk proteins in microflora, and their primary product is an animal-free whey protein isolate. It received FDA approval earlier this year, and, after raising a massive $300M Series C funding round, Perfect Day announced a spinout product— &lt;em&gt;Brave Robot&lt;/em&gt; ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Iger, former Disney CEO, clearly sees potential in the company’s mission, joining the Perfect Day board of directors just this October. Personally, I think the mission of alternative food companies is laudable. I subscribe to the idea that the food of the future will need to be produced sustainably. Still, the promise of companies like Beyond Meat and Perfect Day living up to the hype their gigantic funding rounds and overvalued stock prices will be difficult to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For companies like Perfect Day, I would love to see the company add to their arsenal of animal-free dairy products with not only conventional offerings, but also original concepts. Some companies, like JUST have explored this idea. JUST Egg Folded is an egg replacement that can be popped into a toaster or microwave, and while it reportedly tastes like a cooked egg, it only clearly deviates from it in form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for consumers to adopt alternative products, at least in our current environment, it is not enough to merely imitate existing food— the players I’m most interested in are those that are willing to take creative risks and design &lt;em&gt;truly futuristic food&lt;/em&gt;. If food is produced through a futuristic fermentation process, then I see no reason why it needs to resemble the more traditional foods we are all familiar with. Instead, alternative foods should be marketed as fresh, fashionable, and futuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative food companies are making innovative strides in environmentally friendly and ethical food production. They should mirror these with innovations in their presentation. The biggest players in the alternative food space will be those that make waves with catchy, futuristic foods, not just leeching off existing products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SYNBIO ENTERS ELECTRONICS]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’m a huge fan of Bay Area-based synbio giant Zymergen, a company committed to bringing revolutionary bio-manufactured products to market…]]></description><link>https://mohakjain.github.io/hyaline/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mohakjain.github.io/hyaline/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of Bay Area-based synbio giant Zymergen, a company committed to bringing revolutionary bio-manufactured products to market. It recently raised a $300M series D round of funding, feeding off promising technology and products. One of these products stands out as an extremely non-traditional product to be produced biologically. Zymergen’s HYALINE is the first of its kind: a bio-manufactured film that promises to revolutionize the electronics industry. Moreover, this product was developed and brought to market in just three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HYALINE was co-developed with Japanese Sumitomo Chemical. Zymergen describes the product as “the most dynamic transparent polyimide film available to the market.” Zymergen promises a host of properties that make this screen truly revolutionary, including its flexibility, strength, transparency, and high temperature tolerance. These properties lend it to uses in flexible printed circuits, touch screens, displays, and camera lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though sustainability and promises of previously unattainable properties are enticing,
it remains to be seen whether the market will adopt HYALINE in place of modern petroleum-derived films. If electronics manufacturers choose to adopt Zymergen’s products, the implications will serve to affirm what Zymergen CEO Josh Hoffman’s mission statement:  to “outshine existing materials while dramatically reducing environmental impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HYALINE is currently ready for commercial delivery. Over the coming twelve to eighteen months, Zymergen aims to bring next-generation products to the HYALINE product line. I’m looking forward to seeing how such a dynamic product will be used by electronics manufacturers. I can’t wait for my phone screen to come from sugar and fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IMPOSTER SYNDROME]]></title><description><![CDATA[A few days ago, a friend asked me how not to compare herself to other people.

She’d been feeling down and unmotivated and who could blame her in times like these. The stresses of an extended quarantine to mental health are not lost on me either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I am not immune to comparison or imposter syndrome (a phenomenon where one feels as if they are a fraud and doubts the validity of their accomplishments). That said, there’s a small insight I’ve gleaned that has helped me in dealing with these feelings that my friend mentioned she found insightful. I figured I would share it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of social media, it’s easy to get bogged down in making comparisons. It really takes nothing more than a half second of scrolling down Instagram to see white sand and blue water, expensive resorts, or destination vacations. Meanwhile LinkedIn’s recommended connections show accomplished people more fit for the workforce than I could dream of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I don’t think it’s hard to point out that social media is of course a facade; behind the scenes is a person that has a whole human life and existence. I might argue this is hard to keep in mind when you’re subconsciously scrolling through the social media vortex though, and that directly contributes to feelings of doubt to one’s own quality of life. There are many implications; that Instagram celebrity who travels a lot might have no one they can really call a friend. That person who works non-stop for their resume to look so polished might have poor mental or physical health as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t end there; just walking around campus can be enough to prompt questions of “am I doing enough?” Even professors at top universities, experts in their fields, are known express feelings of self-doubt in the presence of the Nobel laureates who are their colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is about sacrifices. The point is not to demean others for sacrificing other things or to find comfort in the loss of others. Rather, we simply have different priorities in our lives. Personally, not only does this bring me a good deal of comfort, but it also points to one of the many things that keep us human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to recognize the bias that is inherent in making a comparison between you, the person you know down to the last insecurity, the last failure, and the outward caricature of the person you’re drawing a comparison to. It’s just not a fair playing field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[KAFKA ON THE SHORE]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unexpectedly, 2019 was a year where I dove into the genre of magical realism.

I didn’t intend for this (I went into all of these books essentially blind), but among the books I read last year were Haruki Murakami’s &lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt;, Gabriel García Márquez’ &lt;em&gt;One Hundred Years of Solitude&lt;/em&gt;, and finally Murakami’s &lt;em&gt;Kafka on the Shore&lt;/em&gt;. All of these texts are examples of magical realism, a style of fiction that adds magical elements to an otherwise realistic view of the world and paints it as mundane. I found the genre gives authors room to explore complex topics and the potential for the setting of an incredibly compelling story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese author Haruki Murakami’s work tackles the often taboo themes of loneliness, mental illness, and sexuality. I found myself entranced by his writing style— the way he blended the surreal seamlessly into the real, the way I was left genuinely disturbed at certain scenes, the sharp sense of humor and illustrative similes, and the memorable characters. This was the case in &lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt; but I found the magical realism tuned up, as well as the emphasis on these themes in &lt;em&gt;Kafka on the Shore&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel follows two parallel timelines, alternating chapters between two perspectives: one follows 15 year old Kafka Tamura who runs away from home in escape of a terrifying prophecy. The other follows a fifty-year-old man named Nakata, who suffered an accident as a child, rendering him slow and illiterate but able to talk to cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel plays with questions of fate and connectedness, and presents the existence of an alternate world, where people are neither alive nor dead. Several characters throughout the story have been to this world and leave a part of themselves there. In many ways this world can be viewed as the subconscious realm, where time stands still and dreams are experienced. There is a connectedness between characters explored here too. The chapters alternate between the seemingly unrelated plots of Kafka Tamura’s escape and Nakata’s story. Eventually, these stories become intertwined, and this connection between characters across this alternate world become apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is a prominent motif throughout the novel. Murakami’s descriptions of sex are explicit, though not erotically so. They come across as purposeful and intentionally disturbing (recall the protagonist is only 15). Murakami does not restrain characters from telling us their thoughts or describing acts. I am not fond of overt sex in novels, though one might argue that here it is necessary, and this is my only real gripe with this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this novel is as follows: It is trivial to wake up and scribble down everything you remember from your dreams. Murakami’s special talent is in that he made me feel like I was dreaming. I recommend this book to everyone just so that they might experience this, a demonstration of literary skill like none I’ve read before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before reading, I recommend reading a few of Franz Kafka’s short stories, namely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kafka-online.info/the-metamorphosis.html&quot;&gt;“The Metamorphosis”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kafka-online.info/in-the-penal-colony.html&quot;&gt;“In the Penal Colony.”&lt;/a&gt; Murakami’s writing, especially in this novel, is laced with Kafkaesque elements, and these stories provide a good foundation for recognizing these motifs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kafka on the Shore&lt;/em&gt; stood out for me from anything I’ve ever read for a multitude of reasons. Foremost, it was mind-bending to a degree that I had never considered possible from a book. At times reading this novel felt like what I imagine an acid trip feels like. There are many, many parts of this book I have not been able to find the meaning of, and many more which I’m sure I will never discern (though the novel does explain that this is totally acceptable). I finished this book in early October and it never really left my thoughts. I’m still thinking about this book. No other work has made me feel quite this way. I’m not sure I can immediately call it my favorite book, but it’s incredibly compelling, albeit dizzying and bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I feel that, though this novel is certainly worth your time, it is not trivial to understand. The book is absolutely a page-turner, with a driving plot that obviates the novel’s success both in Japan and in western markets. If you’re looking for a work of literature that will leave you endlessly thinking, perhaps even expanding what you consider your realm of conscience, then give this novel a shot.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
