It recently raised a $300M series D round of funding, feeding off promising technology and products. One of these products stands out as an extremely non-traditional product to be produced biologically. Zymergen’s HYALINE is the first of its kind: a bio-manufactured film that promises to revolutionize the electronics industry. Moreover, this product was developed and brought to market in just three years.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":2,"column":548,"offset":549},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":2,"column":548,"offset":549},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"HYALINE was co-developed with Japanese Sumitomo Chemical.
