It’s so <em>strange</em>. The aesthetic of this album, with its astral cover art conjures images of something at once ancient and alien. And certainly this is reflected in the music, the first half leaning into a deeply experimental IDM sound, and the second half taking a smoother modern approach to jazz. Hence, the cosmic first half and the drama second half. This is an enveloping and psychedelic music experience, and it’s also one of my favorite albums of all time.</p>\n<p>Flying Lotus right now is a producer with six studio albums, founder of the acclaimed Brainfeeder record label, and collaborator with some of the most prolific acts in music today, like Thundercat or Kendrick Lamar. He’s even got a Netflix show under his belt. Cosmogramma, though, is at this point over ten years old and considered his magnum opus. This is his third album, and I wanted to examine why I love this album so much.</p>\n<p>Right from the start on “Clock Catcher”, the album blasts the listener with an unsettling array of sounds that sound like the introduction to a trippy, otherworldly boss fight. Elements of a percussive background come in one at a time at odd, somewhat idiosyncratic rhythms. From here the album moves into its first IDM track, with “Pickled!”. Heavily layered percussion throughout the track plays background to a lead bass and synths, which quickly give way to layers of high frequency sounds. </p>\n<p>In general, the first couple tracks here all follow this sort of system, with musical elements coming in and out in an entrancing and otherworldly dance. Each song is equipped with a supremely catchy musical idea, either a beat to stay grounded to, or perhaps a repeating pattern in the melody, or an incredible punchy bassline. No track is boring, either being short enough to make up for repetition, or stopping halfway and moving onto an entirely different idea like on “Zodiac Shit”.</p>\n<p>The song “…And The World Laughs With You” features Thom Yorke of Radiohead fame doing the first real vocals on the album. Flying Lotus though, using this voice as just another instrument in his carefully assembled cacophony. Vocal elements do appear again later on the album, but each time Flying Lotus’s arrangement remains mindblowing, preventing the singer from stealing the show. </p>\n<p>“Do The Astral Plane” is the song off here that is most accessible for sure. It’s got an immediately infectious house groove and smooth strings that provide the foundation for a crunchy synth lead and later, sweeping strings to move the listener along. The instruments all come together in the last quarter of the song with a brass solo leading the charge, which feels like the climax of this listening experience.</p>\n<p>By this point, many of the songs have started to feel somewhat less otherworldly, and instead we see the jazzier side of this album, with groovy percussion being punctuated now with piano or brass leads instead. The song “German Haircut” feels entirely like a piece of experimental nu jazz. </p>\n<p>The song “Table Tennis” samples the sound of a bouncing ping pong ball to offset acoustic guitar, percussion, and Laura Darlington’s vocals, in what feels like the most intimate song here. The final track on here is the incredible “Galaxy in Janaki”. It’s a dreamy IDM track with an arpeggiating lead that gives way to an arrangement of strings with yet another bass solo, it’s an epic and appropriate closer for this album.</p>\n<p>Favorite albums are, of course, not just about the music but about associated contexts, emotions, and experiences. <em>Cosmogramma</em> isn’t the type of album I put on when I have friends over, but instead this album has kept me company at deeply solitary moments. I’ve listened to this album in full walking across Berkeley campus at three in the morning. In my room after midnight, tired from working all day yet unable to sleep, and at five in the morning after waking up a little too early. In these moments it’s easy to drift along to the enchanting current of <em>Cosmogramma</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Cosmogramma</em> changed the way I understood the boundaries of music. It expands on the sonic space I understood to even be possible. It sounds as fresh now as it must have the day it came out. Every single time I listen to this album, I encounter another instrument that I didn’t hear before, I find another hidden groove to be enamored with, another element to gravitate to. It’s got freshness, successful experimentation, and consistency. It’s a masterpiece.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"COSMOGRAMMA: ALBUM REVIEW","date":"June 01, 2021","description":"Cosmogramma (2010) is widely considered to be legendary producer Flying Lotus' magnum opus.
