It recently raised a $300M series D round of funding, feeding off promising technology and products. One of these products stands out as an extremely non-traditional product to be produced biologically. Zymergen’s HYALINE is the first of its kind: a bio-manufactured film that promises to revolutionize the electronics industry. Moreover, this product was developed and brought to market in just three years.</p>\n<p>HYALINE was co-developed with Japanese Sumitomo Chemical. Zymergen describes the product as “the most dynamic transparent polyimide film available to the market.” Zymergen promises a host of properties that make this screen truly revolutionary, including its flexibility, strength, transparency, and high temperature tolerance. These properties lend it to uses in flexible printed circuits, touch screens, displays, and camera lenses.</p>\n<p>Though sustainability and promises of previously unattainable properties are enticing,\nit remains to be seen whether the market will adopt HYALINE in place of modern petroleum-derived films. If electronics manufacturers choose to adopt Zymergen’s products, the implications will serve to affirm what Zymergen CEO Josh Hoffman’s mission statement:  to “outshine existing materials while dramatically reducing environmental impacts.”</p>\n<p>HYALINE is currently ready for commercial delivery. Over the coming twelve to eighteen months, Zymergen aims to bring next-generation products to the HYALINE product line. I’m looking forward to seeing how such a dynamic product will be used by electronics manufacturers. I can’t wait for my phone screen to come from sugar and fermentation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IMPOSTER SYNDROME","date":"September 28, 2020","description":"Zymergen’s HYALINE is the first of its kind: a bio-manufactured film that promises to revolutionize the electronics industry.","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYCAwQF/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABxz7VrCkMAF//xAAaEAEAAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQMSAAQR/9oACAEBAAEFAog4AKdsZsjzjOyulW5//8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwEjjX//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhAR/9oACAECAQE/AWelf//EABsQAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABERASITJh/9oACAEBAAY/ApcycGkaql2Uf//EABoQAAMBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABETEhQeH/2gAIAQEAAT8h+OQ6WtVllF4xYVdbJlWCkJ8O3O9jP//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQW/8A/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAR/9oACAEDAQE/EDBbC//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEf/aAAgBAgEBPxBkC1v/xAAbEAEAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhUTFxgf/aAAgBAQABPxAGAixw+J7Qc6FfeRolb02hxjDjwQfxNePQiJPFAqXuk//Z","aspectRatio":1.5118110236220472,"src":"/static/ca562fc571514e5d86e096f7418a2bc2/a6352/hyaline.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ca562fc571514e5d86e096f7418a2bc2/a6352/hyaline.jpg 960w","sizes":"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hyaline/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/imposter-syndrome/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IMPOSTER SYNDROME"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721","3649515864"]}
