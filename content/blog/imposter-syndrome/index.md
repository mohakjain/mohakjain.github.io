A few days ago, a friend asked me how not to compare herself to other people. She’d been feeling down and unmotivated and who could blame her in times like these. The stresses of an extended quarantine to mental health are not lost on me either.

Admittedly, I am not immune to comparison or imposter syndrome (a phenomenon where one feels as if they are a fraud and doubts the validity of their accomplishments). That said, there’s a small insight I’ve gleaned that has helped me in dealing with these feelings that my friend mentioned she found insightful. I figured I would share it today.

In the age of social media, it’s easy to get bogged down in making comparisons. It really takes nothing more than a half second of scrolling down Instagram to see white sand and blue water, expensive resorts, or destination vacations. Meanwhile LinkedIn’s recommended connections show accomplished people more fit for the workforce than I could dream of being.

With this in mind, I don’t think it’s hard to point out that social media is of course a facade; behind the scenes is a person that has a whole human life and existence. I might argue this is hard to keep in mind when you’re subconsciously scrolling through the social media vortex though, and that directly contributes to feelings of doubt to one’s own quality of life. There are many implications; that Instagram celebrity who travels a lot might have no one they can really call a friend. That person who works non-stop for their resume to look so polished might have poor mental or physical health as a result. 

It doesn’t end there; just walking around campus can be enough to prompt questions of “am I doing enough?” Even professors at top universities, experts in their fields, are known express feelings of self-doubt in the presence of the Nobel laureates who are their colleagues. 

Life is about sacrifices. The point is not to demean others for sacrificing other things or to find comfort in the loss of others. Rather, we simply have different priorities in our lives. Personally, not only does this bring me a good deal of comfort, but it also points to one of the many things that keep us human.

The key is to recognize the bias that is inherent in making a comparison between you, the person you know down to the last insecurity, the last failure, and the outward caricature of the person you’re drawing a comparison to. It’s just not a fair playing field.
