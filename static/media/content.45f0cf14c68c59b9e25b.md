Hi. I'm interested in using software to make biological research and healthcare delivery more efficient, and I have a soft spot for startups and venture capital. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley (EECS & Bioengineering '22).

### ➔ Writing
I write about startups, technology, culture, and more on my blog, <a href="https://mohakjain.substack.com/" target="_blank">Art & Artifice</a>. Some of my writing is linked below.

### ➔ Conversation Starters

- I enjoy books, blogs, and video essays.
- I'm quite partial to the humanities, particularly literature, psychology, and art history.
- I'm an enormous music nerd interested in listening to as many genres as I can get my ears on.
- I sometimes dig into some variety of pen & paper puzzle. These include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CrackingTheCryptic" target="_blank">Sudoku</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cryptic-crossword" target="_blank">Cryptic Crosswords</a>, Tents, Star Battle, and more.
- Of course, anything (bio)tech-related is welcome too.
